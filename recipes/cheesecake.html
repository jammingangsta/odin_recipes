    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You can make this lovely, sweet treat for 4th July or any patriotic holiday without turning on the oven! Besides the taste and light mousse-like texture, I think your guests will enjoy the iconic stars and stripes design provided by the fresh blueberries and strawberries.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>16 oz (450g) cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh strawberries, sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and sugar until combined. Press into the bottom of a springform pan to form the crust. Chill in the refrigerator.</li>

        <li>In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.</li>
